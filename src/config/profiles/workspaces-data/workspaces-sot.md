## Stakeholders

| Name | Role | Primary Need | Demo perspective |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mehmet | CFO | Company-wide spend visibility · category vs time · CSV/PDF export | Dashboard w2.4 (Company View) |
| Tammy | CAO (~80 reports) | Ops & Procurement division rollup · cross-location · SLA aging alerts | Dashboard w2.4 (Division View) + approval queue |
| Letza (Lisa Bombard) | AP Coordinator | GL pre-filled by AI · auto-post to CORE · self-service admin | w2.1 AP Queue · w2.2 GL Sync · w2.3 Admin |
| Managers | Direct report supervisors | One-click approve · see receipts inline · no GlobalSearch login | w1.2 Queue · w1.3 Approve |
| Employees | Field staff, Sales, PMs | Submit from mobile · receipt scan · track status without calling AP | w1.1 Submit · w1.4 Status |

---

## Technology Stack — AS-IS (4 disconnected systems)

| System | Function | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Company Intranet | Expense report form (desktop only) | No mobile · no receipt scan · upload fails → email workaround |
| GlobalSearch (Square 9 ECM) | Document repository + approval workflow | Approval button grayed out — **BROKEN for months** |
| Email | Manager notification + AP communication | Process outside system · no traceability · approvals by email |
| CORE (accounting ERP) | GL entries · check issuance | Zero integration with GlobalSearch · 100% manual re-entry by AP |

---

## AS-IS Workflow — 8 steps

| Step | Actor | Action | Pain point |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Employee | Fill Intranet form (desktop only) | PP6: desktop-only · PP9: receipt upload fails → email workaround |
| 2 | GlobalSearch | Document uploaded automatically | OK — works |
| 3 | GlobalSearch | Sends email notification to manager | System notifies but approval UI is broken |
| 4 | Manager (Tammy) | Tries to approve in GlobalSearch | **PP5: button grayed out** · approves by email instead |
| 5 | AP (Letza) | Reviews expense in GlobalSearch | PP1: can't see receipts · requests separately by email |
| 6 | AP (Letza) | Manual GL breakdown line by line | PP8: ~15 min/expense · inconsistent across AP staff |
| 7 | AP (Letza) | Manual re-entry into CORE | PP8: copy field by field · error-prone · biggest bottleneck |
| 8 | CORE | Issues check and processes payment | Only automated output in the whole process |

---

## TO-BE Workflow — Strata unified platform

| Step | Actor | Action | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Employee | Mobile/Web app · snap receipt · AI auto-fill | Seconds vs minutes · mobile-first |
| 2 | Platform | Receipt + form → submission engine | Replaces GlobalSearch backend |
| 3 | Platform | Email + push notification to manager | Parity + push added |
| 4 | Manager | One-click approve with inline receipts | Fixes broken UX · PP1 + PP5 resolved |
| 5 | Platform | Auto-routes approved expense to AP queue | No manual handoff |
| 6 | AP (Letza) | GL pre-filled by AI rules engine · confirm/override | PP8 resolved · major time save |
| 7 | AP (Letza) | Auto-post to CORE via API/RPA after confirm | PP8 resolved · manual re-entry eliminated |
| 8 | CORE | Issues check (unchanged) | Parity |

---

## Pain Points — 10 identified, 9 strongly resolved

| # | Pain Point | Where | Who | Resolution | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP1 | Cannot see receipts during approval | Step 4 · GlobalSearch | Tammy / Managers | Inline receipt viewer in approval card | STRONG |
| PP2 | No departmental spending visibility | Post-payment reporting | Tammy (CAO) · Mehmet | Reporting dashboard with division rollup | STRONG |
| PP3 | No summary reports or dashboards | Reporting | Mehmet · Tammy · Letza | Company-wide dashboard · filters · export | STRONG |
| PP4 | Risk of losing GlobalSearch platform | Entire backbone | All | New platform replaces GlobalSearch end-to-end | STRONG |
| PP5 | GlobalSearch approval UI grayed out | Step 4 | Managers | New clean approval UX · shown in demo explicitly | STRONG |
| PP6 | Cannot add managers to approval dropdown | Step 1 + Admin | Letza (#1 ask) | Self-service Admin module | STRONG |
| PP7 | Expense categories need updating | Step 1 + Admin | Letza | Admin module — add/edit/archive categories | STRONG |
| PP8 | Manual re-entry from GlobalSearch into CORE | Step 7 — biggest bottleneck | Letza | Auto-post via API or RPA after GL confirm | STRONG |
| PP9 | Email workarounds for receipt upload | Step 1 | Employees | Multi-format upload · explicit messaging in UI | IMPLICIT → needs explicit callout |
| PP10 | Must open each report one by one | Reporting | Mehmet | Dashboard with filters + drill-down + export | STRONG |

## Open Questions (from Designer Brief — 8 gaps)

| # | Question | How demo handles it |
|---|---|---|
| OQ1 | Native app vs PWA/Responsive Web? | Demo shows responsive web (mobile viewport simulated in ExpenseSubmitScene) |
| OQ2 | Multiple receipts per expense line explicitly supported? | "+ Add another receipt" button + "JPG PNG PDF · multiple supported" label |
| OQ3 | Reject → Resubmit full flow (states, re-review)? | Toggle in w1.3: approve or reject scenario, resubmit card visible |
| OQ4 | Tammy's division rollup hierarchy definition? | w2.4 Tammy tab shows Ops & Procurement with "38 reports" |
| OQ5 | SLA threshold — 3 days, who gets notified? | Badge "> 3 days ⚠️" on Carlos Ruiz card + "Push sent to manager" |
| OQ6 | Monthly category comparison (Mehmet ask)? | Side-by-side bars April vs May with % delta in w2.4 |
| OQ7 | CORE integration: API vs RPA? | Text in w2.2: "Auto-post to CORE · integration method TBD" |
| OQ8 | Receipt upload messaging explicit? | w1.1: "Camera · Gallery · File · JPG PNG PDF · multiple receipts supported" |

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Budget alerts / spend caps (Mehmet: "not an immediate need")
- Full ERP replacement (CORE payment system unchanged — integration only)
- Travel booking / pre-approval
- Native mobile app (responsive web for prototype)

## Design Mandates (from Designer Brief)

1. **"Wow moment #1"** — Snap a receipt and watch fields auto-fill (w1.1 OCR animation)
2. **"Wow moment #2"** — See receipts inline when approving (w1.3 — resolves PP#1 directly)
3. **"Wow moment #3"** — See the entire company's spend on one dashboard for the first time (w2.4)

> "This is not a reinvention — it's the current process simplified."
> Same flow, made to actually work. Mobile-first for field staff. Desktop fine for managers/AP/CFO.
